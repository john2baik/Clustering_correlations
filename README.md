# Clustering_correlations
K-means Clustering algorithm to find patterns and correlations between attributes. 

Please use 4 arguments when running the Kmeans.java program.
Example:

java Kmeans [Data Filepath] [NewFile Filepath] [k] [Threshold] [# of tuples to show]

k = number of clusters to be created

Threshold = Minimum percentage of difference before new clustering stops.

Example: 

5 -> Minimum of 5% difference between new and old cluster centroids before creating new cluster required.
number of tuples to show = How many tuples to be returned during file creation for ease of read.

Run K-means clustering on any CSV numerical data
